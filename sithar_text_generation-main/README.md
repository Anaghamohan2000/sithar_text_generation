# ðŸŽ¼ SITHAR

Here's is the app that we created to generate text using *LSTM* . We used the lyrics of the songs sung by Sithara Ramakrishnan,an Indian Playback singer . Sithar is designed to automatically generate lyrics when you give a keyword as an input. 
Different sequence *related* of words will be generated depending on the input you give. It's fun to playaround by giving different words.. 

ðŸ¤­ Sithar sure will make you laugh with the variety poems it writes. ðŸ¤­ 




The text data was created by webscrapping and uploaded in kaggle.
The dataset used .: https://www.kaggle.com/cicykagnes/sithara-song-generator

# *Sithar_nlp.py : Definition of functions*

1. Import necessary libraries like NumPy,TensorFlow, etcâ€¦..
          
     ## Libraries used :
                  
                    
          numpy 1.19.5
          streamlit 0.82.0
          tensorflow 2.4.1
          python-docx-0.8.11
          regex  2.2.1
                  

2. Code contains a class called data_processing which is used for a batch of training examples from a document containing songs.It converts every charaters into lower case letters

3. Methods in data_processing :

         1) getText: which loads data from the document and returns the songs after arranging songs in paragraphs.
 
         2) clean_text: which remove nonalphabetic characters in the songs 

         3) data_xy: this function takes an index and makes x and y dataset, in x contain sequence_length of characters which comes after the given index and y contains elements             of x after x has been shifted one step in the right direction

         4) data_generator: this function generates a batch_size of training examples and returns it at every iteration of an infinite while loop

4. MyModel class is used to build a model. It has a method called forward which returns a compiled model and model contains layers

                1) Embedding layer

                2) bidirectional lstm layer

                3) dropout layer

                4) lstm layer

                5) dropout layer

                6) dense layer

                7) dropout layer

                8) dense layer

5 . Prediction class is used to predict which takes arguments as a model, tokenizer, index to words dictionary in its __init__method.

   It contains a method called pred_next_word which takes the user input and convert that into an index using a dictionary use the trained model to predict the probabilities     over the entire words in the dictionary then select one index and convert it into a word using the dictionary

6 . Train_model is used to train the model. this creates the objects of data_processing and MyModel classes using train the model and saves it in the drive, it returns model and     index to word dictionary and object of tokenizer.  
7 . Then the train_model function is called to get the model and passe the returned values into the method of prediction class object called pred_next_word which is called 20   times to create a paragraph of 20 words through inputting the returned value again into the model in the next iteration.





# Web app and deployment :

   Sithar is created using a tool called streamlit. There are 3 pages namely , home , text generation and about .
   Home displays the name of our app . It has a button to check how to use the app.
   Text generation page has a text input box ,where the user can input the keyword to generate the text.
   The about page has links to the source code , the dataset and to contact the creators .

# Walkthrough video and Code Explanation :

## How to use the app :
*  Go to the top left corner and click on the arrow to go to navigation menu.
*  To generate the text go to 'Text generation' page and input the keyword in Manglish. A sequence of 20 words will be generated.
*  Please use the same keywords as mentioned in lower case letters or please visit the dataset to get more keywords.
*  To know about the web page and the source code used go to 'About' page.

## How to configure :

To run the app locally in your system ,
 * Install the necessary modules in the system as mentioned in the requirements.txt
 * Download the files mentioned and store it in a folder
  *  my_model.h5
  *  my_model.json
  *  sithar_frnt.py
  *  sithara_songs_data.txt
  *  123.jpg
  *  345.jpg
  *  567.jpg
 ## To run the app locally :
 * Now go to the path where you saved the files and run the following command in the cmd to connect to localhost:port 8501 and launch the app.
                
                streamlit run sithar_frnt.py
                
 The name we gave to our streamlit file is sithar_frnt.py .You can choose your desired file name.
